{"name":"Nessus-analyzer","tagline":"Ruby script to analyze Nessus files and generate statistics","body":"# Tool to analyze Nessus output\r\n\r\n## Running the analyzer\r\nEvery time you run the analyzer you need to supply two options:\r\n\r\n1. The file or you want to analyze.\r\n2. The action you want to take (find top events, show stats, send to graphite, etc)\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n* [Send data to MongoDB](https://github.com/gehrhorn/nessus-analyzer/wiki/MongoDB) to maintain a historical view of vulnerability data.\r\n* [Send data to Graphite](https://github.com/gehrhorn/nessus-analyzer/wiki/Graphite) to build a vulnerability dashboard.\r\n* [Print some pretty statistics](https://github.com/gehrhorn/nessus-analyzer/wiki/Display-Statistics)\r\n\r\n## Dependencies\r\n* [ruby-nessus](https://github.com/mephux/ruby-nessus)\r\n* [mongo-ruby-driver](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-ruby-driver)\r\n* [terminal-table](https://github.com/visionmedia/terminal-table)\r\n* [bson_ext](https://rubygems.org/gems/bson_ext) - *not actually required, but significant perfornamce penalties witout it.*\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n* I would love your help. Features, tests, documentation, bug reporting, etc.\r\nReally, I would love it.\r\n* Fork the project. Generally I think [Scott Chacon]\r\n(http://scottchacon.com/2011/08/31/github-flow.html) offers good advice on the\r\nsubject.\r\n* Make a topic branch.\r\n* Squash your commits.\r\n* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a\r\n  future version unintentionally. (I realize there are no tests now, the irony\r\n  isn't lost on me).\r\n* Don't edit the version, tags, or history.\r\n* Send me a pull request. \r\n\r\n:beers:\r\n","google":"UA-41573678-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
